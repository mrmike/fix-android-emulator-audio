# fix-android-emulator-audio

The goal of the script is to fix common Bluetooth issue when running Android Emulator on macOS. Script modifies emulator configs in batch, so you don't have to do it manually, one by one.

## Usage
Simply call the script from the repo. Before calling the script make sure that emulator is closed.
```bash
 ./fix-android-emulator-audio

# Sample output
ðŸ”Š Processing emulators from: /Users/<USERNAME>/.android/avd
ðŸ”Š Processing - Pixel_5_API_31.avd
âœ… Done - Pixel_5_API_31.avd
ðŸ”Š Processing - 4.7_WXGA_API_27.avd
âœ… Done - 4.7_WXGA_API_27.avd
```

By default script will look on emulators located at `~/.android/avd`. Script accepts argument with custom `avd` directory localization
```bash
./fix-android-emulator-audio path/to/your/avd/directory
```

When running emulator for the first time after applying the fix make sure that data is wiped and emulator is started with Cold Boot option.
